Noverber 2:PyTorch 2D Tensors: Creation, Manipulation, and Operations:This Jupyter notebook serves as a tutorial on the fundamentals of handling two-dimensional (2D) tensors in PyTorch. It demonstrates how to create these tensors from Python lists and Pandas DataFrames and how to inspect their basic properties like dimension, shape, and size. The code also covers the conversion between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays, a common requirement for data manipulation. A significant portion is dedicated to indexing and slicing, explaining how to access and modify specific elements or sections of a tensor. Lastly, the notebook illustrates key mathematical operations, including element-wise addition, scalar multiplication, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, and matrix multiplication for tensors of different sizes using torch.mm.

November 4:This Jupyter Notebook is a hands-on tutorial explaining how to perform automatic differentiation in PyTorch. It guides you through setting a tensor's requires_grad property to True and then using the .backward() method to compute gradients. The file provides code examples for finding simple derivatives, like for $y=x^2$, and extends to calculating partial derivatives for multi-variable functions. It also includes practical examples, such as plotting a function alongside its derivative and examining the derivative of the relu activation function.

November 5:This Jupyter notebook provides a tutorial on creating a custom toy_set dataset class in PyTorch by inheriting from torch.utils.data.Dataset and implementing the __len__ and __getitem__ methods. It then demonstrates how to define custom data transformation classes, such as add_mult, by implementing a __call__ method to modify data samples. The notebook shows how to apply these transforms either manually to individual samples or automatically by passing the transform object to the dataset's constructor. Finally, it introduces torchvision.transforms.Compose as a way to chain multiple transformations together, illustrating how the order of composed transforms (e.g., add_mult then mult, or vice-versa) affects the final output data.

November 6:This notebook teaches you how to build a custom PyTorch Dataset to load your own image files and labels from a CSV. It also shows you how to use torchvision.transforms to easily apply pre-processing steps like cropping, flipping, and converting images to tensors.
