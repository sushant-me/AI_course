Noverber 2:PyTorch 2D Tensors: Creation, Manipulation, and Operations:This Jupyter notebook serves as a tutorial on the fundamentals of handling two-dimensional (2D) tensors in PyTorch. It demonstrates how to create these tensors from Python lists and Pandas DataFrames and how to inspect their basic properties like dimension, shape, and size. The code also covers the conversion between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays, a common requirement for data manipulation. A significant portion is dedicated to indexing and slicing, explaining how to access and modify specific elements or sections of a tensor. Lastly, the notebook illustrates key mathematical operations, including element-wise addition, scalar multiplication, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, and matrix multiplication for tensors of different sizes using torch.mm.
